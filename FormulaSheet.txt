The PPV prediction equations are:
	Holmberg-Persson

V = K ((Q_max^A)/R^B )	

	USBM (Unitech States Bureau of Mines)   
V = K(R/vQmax)^(-B)

	Langefors – Kihlstrom
V = K(Q_max/R^(2/3) )^(-B)

	CMRI – Central Mining Research Institute

V = n +K(vQmax/R)^

	R. Rajesh and T.Singh
V = K.R^(-B).Q_max^A.e^(-aR)

Note that: Maximum Charge per delay (Q) is calculated as:
Q = N.l.?2.p/4. p




Where N = number of explosive cartridges in the boreholes
	L = length of each cartridge
	P = explosive density, (kg/m3)

 K, B and A = 	empirical constants, which can be determined by multiple regression 			analysis of two independent variables.
a = energy factor. It is dependent on the medium through which energy passes
n = numerical constant
Q = Maximum charge per delay of explosives
R = horizontal distance from the blast zone to the point of  PPV measurement
